If you want to clone a GitHub repository, make changes, and then push your modified version to your own GitHub repository, follow these steps:

First, clone the repository you want to work on:
git clone <original-repo-url>

Then navigate to the repository
cd repo-name

Create a new github repository in your github

Since the cloned repo points to the original authorâ€™s repo, you need to change it to your own:

Check the Current Remote
git remote -v

Remove the Existing Remote
git remote remove origin

Add Your New GitHub Repository
git remote add origin <your-new-repo-url>

Make Changes to the Code
Edit files, add new files, modify models, or update configurations as needed.

Add & Commit Changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated files"

Push to Your GitHub Repository
git push -u origin main

If the original repository had a different default branch (e.g., master instead of main), use:

git push -u origin master

Setting up virtual environment without use of Conda
If virtualenv is not installed
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv

After the installation run,
python3 -m virtualenv ~/Envs/environment_name

source ~/Envs/environment_name/bin/activate
